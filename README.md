# ConvUtils

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Evizero/ConvUtils.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Evizero/ConvUtils.jl) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/Evizero/ConvUtils.jl/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/Evizero/ConvUtils.jl?branch=master)

Small utility package for working and visualizing convolutional
neural networks. The package is not really intended to be used by
anyone but me, but feel free to do so according to the license.
This is just a different way of saying that I made no effort in
making this package clean, well documented, generic, or reusable.
